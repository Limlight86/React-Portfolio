      I am a full stack web developer based in Miami, FL. Before going on the
      journey of becoming a developer and submersing myself in the world of
      tech, I was a chef, a Whole Foods Market marketing specialist, and a
      paralegal working on a big class action law suit against BP for the 2010
      oil spill. Inspired by my two best friends which have been coding for a
      combined 15 years and introduced to Wyncode by a successful alumni, I
      began my coding journey!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned so much in my time coding. Wyncode was an amazing
      experience and they forged me into a committed and adaptable developer. I
      am constantly hungry to learn more and have dedicated myself to mastering
      code! I am a big advocate of Agile methodology and believe that a strong
      team that works well together can make anything possible!
    </p>

      I am very interested in front end technologies and my main focus right now
      is ReactJS and Javascript and have experience working with a dedicated
      UX/UI team. I have experience working with back-end technologies, mostly
      Ruby on Rails and feel comfortable working with databases. I am flexible
      and will be ready to learn any language, library or framework required for
      any project. I am currently learning React Native to take my skills into
      the mobile world and focusing on other technologies that will take my Web
      Dev skills to the next level such as GraphQL, Apollo, Redux, Gatsby NodeJS
      and diversifying my front end repertoire with Angular.
